Now I’ll provide the necessary background to understand step 4.\n\n\rVisual examples\rFrom a musical perspective, we’ll be dealing with chords (collections of more\rthan two notes) and their transpositions (translating them by some distance),\rbut, from a mathematical perspective, we only need to follow the already mentioned\rsteps 1, 2 and 3.\nWe’ll work with the unitary circle, the circle with radius 1 and whose\rcenter is the origin of the Cartesian Plane.\rEach point in the unitary circle can be thought of as a possible musical note,\rif we conveniently match them.\nIn that sense, let’s work with the following pairing:\n\r\r\rNote\r\r\rC\r\r\rDb\r\r\rD\r\r\rEb\r\r\rE\r\r\rF\r\r\rGb\r\r\rG\r\r\rAb\r\r\rA\r\r\rBb\r\r\rB\r\r\r\r\rAngle\r\r\r$ (0/12)*360^{°} $\r\r\r$ (1/12)*360^{°} $\r\r\r$ (2/12)*360^{°} $\r\r\r$ (3/12)*360^{°} $\r\r\r$ (4/12)*360^{°} $\r\r\r$ (5/12)*360^{°} $\r\r\r$ (6/12)*360^{°} $\r\r\r$ (7/12)*360^{°} $\r\r\r$ (8/12)*360^{°} $\r\r\r$ (9/12)*360^{°} $\r\r\r$ (10/12)*360^{°}$\r\r\r$ (11/12)*360^{°}$\r\r\r\rLet’s start with a simple case: The major chord\nConsider the C major chord, {C, E, G}, which we can represent in the Cartesian\rPlane as the following set of points:\nC : \\(\\left(\\cos(0^{°}),\\sin(0^{°})\\right)\\)\nE : \\(\\left(\\cos(120^{°}),\\sin(120^{°})\\right)\\)\nG : \\(\\left(\\cos(210^{°}),\\sin(210^{°})\\right)\\)\nNow, let’s rotate each of those three points by \\(60^{°}\\) with respect to the origin, as we can see in the following animation, where the initial points/notes shown correspond to C, E and G, in that order:\nFrom a musical perspective, we’ve transposed the C major chord by 3 semitones and landed on Eb major.\nThe set of trajectories that the notes from C major take along the unitary circle to get to the notes in Eb major is called the voice leading betwwen C major and Eb major.\nLet me clarify that the voice leadings which we will be initially dealing with in this post are precisely those which satisfy that no pair of distinct notes from the initial chord end up at the same note in the final chord. In that sense, when we tranpose/rotate any chord with some number \\(n\\) of notes, the number of possible voice leadings between such chord and its transposition is precisely\r\\(n! = n\\cdot(n-1)\\cdot(\\dots)\\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 \\enspace\\).\nGoing back to our concrete case, let’s see some voice leading examples for the transposition from C major to Eb major:\nIn this post, we’ll focus on two properties that we’d like a voice leading (which we’ll denote as VL) between a chord and someits transpositions to have:\nThe sum of the length of the trajectories which define VL, also known as the voice leading size, is the smallest one out of all the possible voice leadings between the initial chord and its transposition.\rThe trajectories which define VL share the same direction, that is, they are all clockwise or all anticlockwise.\r\r\n\r","date":1623974400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1624006466,"objectID":"113666394fdd3876ac437d797b2b3100","permalink":"https://lucio-cornejo.github.io/post/a-glimpse-into-the-world-of-voice-leading/","publishdate":"2021-06-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/a-glimpse-into-the-world-of-voice-leading/","section":"post","summary":"This post is not finished.\rI’ll continue updating it.\n\nI’ll begin to describe the surprisingly interesting musical experiment which\rfirst piqued my interest into how, from certain simple musical problems,\runexpected patterns and relationships can emerge and be, partially, explained\rthrough mathematics.","tags":[],"title":"A glimpse into the world of Voice Leading","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"\r\rUseful links for this new adventure\r\rLa Matemática en la Música\n\rMatemática en la Musicología\n\rMatemáticas y música: perspectivas a través del tiempo\n\rVoice leading lecture series\n\rThe Distance Geometry of Music\n\rMathematical Music Theory Blog\n\rScale Theory, Serial Theory and Voice Leading\n\rAspects of Well-Formed Scales\n\rThe Group-Theoretic Description of 12-Fold and Microtonal Pitch Systems\n\rLa Teoria de Números y la Teoría de Grupos en el estudio de escalas musicales microtonales\n\rEssential Neo-Riemannian Theory for Today’s Musician\n\rAxiomatic Scale Theory\n\r\r\r","date":1623974400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1624005108,"objectID":"d91578592be75010e6bdb4c627a931b3","permalink":"https://lucio-cornejo.github.io/post/getting-started/","publishdate":"2021-06-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/getting-started/","section":"post","summary":"Useful links for this new adventure","tags":[],"title":"Getting started","type":"post"},{"authors":["Lucio Cornejo"],"categories":null,"content":" Create your slides in Markdown - click the Slides button to check out the example.
